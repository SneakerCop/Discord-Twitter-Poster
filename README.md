# Prerequisites #

A Linux/Windows/OSX server that's always running. (I host this program on a free google cloud debian server)

A Discord bot user (Create one [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ "Discord"))

A Twitter developer account (Apply for one [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html "Twitter"))

# Running #

Install node.js (Download [here](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS"))

Install these modules:

request-promise-native
discord.js
twit

Replace the TYPEHERE fields in settings.json with all your info.

Run index.js
(Optionally run with something like PM2)

Invite the bot to your server using the following link (replace BOTCLIENTIDHERE with your client id in general info): 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOTCLIENTIDHERE&scope=bot&permissions=0

You're good to go!
