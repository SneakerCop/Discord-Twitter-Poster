# Prerequisites #

A Linux/Windows/OSX server that's always running. (I host this program on a free google cloud debian server)

A Discord bot user (Create one at https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/)

A Twitter developer account (Apply for one at https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access.html)

Install node.js (Download at https://nodejs.org/en/)

Install these modules:

request-promise-native
discord.js
twit

Running:

Replacre the TYPEHERE fields in settings.json with all your info.

Invite the bot to your server using the following link (replace BOTCLIENTIDHERE with your client id in general info): 
https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=BOTCLIENTIDHERE&scope=bot&permissions=0.

Run index.js
(Optionally run with something like PM2)

You're good to go!
